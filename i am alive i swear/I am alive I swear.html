				<h2>108</h2>
				<p><i>Josie Romano</i></p>
				<h3>
					Project Statement
				</h3>
				<p>The root of this work is the number 108. A number that stands for wholeness of existence, and ironically the temperature at which your organs begin to fail. The work explores the innate connection between all things and moments where we are particularly mindful. When do we experience oneness in our everyday lives? Drawing inspiration from avant-garde and minimalist composers, Josie seeks to bridge the gap between, mindfulness, new media art, and self-discovery. Following a set of parameters, she begins with a basic meditation practice. Next, with a single contribution per week allowance, using a strict handheld, spontaneous found footage/sound rule, and finally enters a piece of the week into this digital diary. The end result is a cumulative collage. 
                </p>
                The collage follows the day-to-day life of the artist and the format forces decisiveness, reflection, and pure attention to those moments. The work strives to discover the rhythm and harmony of life whether in nature, technology, or society. The exercise calls for deliberate attentiveness to one specific moment on a weekly basis, resulting in a raw feeling output. 
                </p>
                Simple mindfulness and metta (loving-kindness) meditations were coupled with research from Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Jainism. In this, Josie was looking for unifying teachings and found the concept of "Prakriti." Prakriti considers all nature to be an embodiment of the divine presence. It names humans "jivatmas" or individual souls, who are intrinsically connected to the "Paramatma" or the supreme soul which is ever-present in the natural world. This is represented in the work as a unifying hum of 108 hertz that can be heard throughout. There is a continuity in this sound, although semi-abrasive, as well as a new sound being introduced every 27 seconds, a divisor of 108. 
                </p>
                She hopes this piece is a small part of the ongoing conversation surrounding a digital world of maximal information intake and promotes taking a second to slow down, reflect, and experience mindful observation without the clutter of superficial identity and material goods.

				<h3>
					Artist Statement
				</h3>			
				<p>Josie Romano is an audio-visual artist living in Upstate New York. The mediums of photography, video, sound clips, stickers, or doodles provide a way of interacting and collecting pieces of the environment around her. Currently finishing a degree in music business, her work is deeply informed by a passion for music and sound. Her compositions often manifest through maximalist collage, found content, street photography, collection of textures, and objet d'art. The resulting multi-sensory experiences touch on themes surrounding consumption, overstimulation, disembodiment, harmony, and violence between the Earth, humans, technology, and the nature of contemporary existence.

				<h2>R3AL</h2>
				<p><i>Ismael Hernandez</i></p>
				<h3>
					Project Statement
				</h3>
				<p>Have you ever had a blast at a concert, enjoyed the view from the passenger seat, or just had a good time with your friends? In most of these instances, I feel like time goes by way too fast. This is why I chose a video, a time-based medium that allowed me to control the space-time continuum. I drew inspiration from YouTube bloggers and the insights of my classmates. In one of our sessions, we discussed the concept of “core core” and how any vibe or aesthetic can contribute to the movement. I did some research and fell in love with the idea. My project R3AL, emphasizes the idea of enjoying the present, not just living it but fully attending to each molecule of the moment. Using an archive of surreal clips shot and collected throughout the past four years I have created a composite of my favorite place New York City. This diaristic video hopes to evoke the passionate sentiments I have experienced and give pause with that of the viewer.

					Artist Statement

				<p>Ismael Hernandez was born and raised in Washington Heights, New York. Growing up in the projects, he always knew he wanted to do better for his family. From a young age, he started working, sacrificing a lot to put himself and his family as a priority. These videos often act as a witness to his multifaceted experiences as a New Yorker who is deeply invested in capturing slices of history that often go untold. His work takes the form of sonic compositions, videos, and photography that speak to his love of New York City. His project is a mixture of still and dynamic film, all of which seek to illuminate the depth of human emotions and the passing of time. He often uses a diverse set of clips to create an atmosphere of nostalgia and good vibes.

				<h2>Inner Discourse</h2>
				<p><i>Jack Vazquez-Perez</i></p>
				<h3>
					Project Statement
				</h3>
				<p>This project delves into the phenomenon of self-dialogue, a universal practice often undertaken for diverse reasons. Within this exploration, I aim to elucidate my personal motivations for engaging in introspective conversations. The endeavor is propelled by a quest to unearth a profound understanding of my existence and purpose. However, the internal dialogue reveals a perpetual state of uncertainty, as the self within me grapples with an ongoing process of acceptance. 
                </p>
                The thematic core of this project revolves around poignant subjects such as insecurity, apprehensions about the future, existential worth, fear of obscurity, and the intricacies of procrastination. Through the medium of discourse with oneself, I seek to navigate the complex terrain of genuine emotions and authentic self-awareness. While the project is driven by an overarching objective to uncover definitive answers, it becomes evident that such resolutions elude discovery. Instead, the project propels an acceptance of life's inherent ambiguity. It advocates embracing the ephemeral nature of existence, acknowledging that certainties are elusive, and the path forward involves cultivating an appreciation for life's nuances. The ultimate aspiration is to foster a realization that, in the absence of concrete answers, the essence of life lies in learning to derive joy and fulfillment from the transient moments shared with those in one's immediate surroundings.

				<h3>
					Artist Statement
				</h3>			
				<p>I am Jack Vazquez-Perez, a 21-year-old artist hailing from The Bronx, with roots tracing back to Mexico through my parents. Throughout my life, a pervasive sense of displacement has accompanied me, leaving me questioning my sense of belonging. In the confines of school, I often found myself pondering the source of this internal discord, grappling with the perceived incongruence between my appearance and my Mexican heritage. 
                </p>
                In these moments of introspection, I unearthed a solace that emanated from within. Nights were spent engaging in self-dialogue and contemplating the uncertainties of the future. However, during my high school years, I embraced the understanding that conforming to societal notions of "normal" held no significance as long as I found comfort within my own identity. This would still be a challenge as navigating the intricacies of self-discovery became a personal odyssey, perpetually shrouded in shades of gray, yet I persistently sought to comprehend the evolving facets of my being. 
                </p>
                In my artistic endeavors, particularly within the realm of video creation, I endeavor to externalize this journey. Each element, from the evocative sounds to the nuanced dialogue and carefully curated aesthetics, serves a deliberate purpose in capturing the essence of my self-exploration. My aspiration is not only to deepen my understanding of self but also to extend a sense of shared humanity to others traversing similar paths. Through my work, I aim to dismantle the isolation that often accompanies personal journeys, fostering a connection that transcends the boundaries of individual experiences.
