				<h2>Futur Mechs</h2>
				<p><i>Jessica Lian</i></p>
				<h3>Project Statement</h3>

				<p>

				<i>Futur Mechs</i> was inspired by today’s rising concerns and comments about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the way it has seeped through our daily life. The piece illustrates a futuristic world where humans are powering AI machines, revealing humans as a key source of input for future machines — Futur Mechs. 

				Lian challenges AI art generators by creating her own series of “AI generated” art, mimicking the AI style of bright and unusual. From the foundation of these five illustrations, Futur Mechs delves further as a critique on the boundaries between human and AI technologies, questioning where to draw the line as to what is human and what is AI. 

				The creation process of “AI generated” art was challenging when Lian lacked a database of images in her head to create pieces of work within a matter of minutes. Despite her attempt to reference AI art styles, the comparison might be easy to tell. Through her work process, Lian avoids tools such as ChatGPT and Dall-E and instead uses applications like Procreate, Premiere Pro, and After Effects to challenge her creative abilities without the aid of AI. The work demonstrates the possibility of making art without using AI text generators in one’s art making process. 

				Lian’s work illustrates that AI is just an optional tool available to be used. After viewing Futur Mechs, she invites you to think more critically the next time you come across AI tools: 
					<ul> > When we talk to ChatGPT or Dall-E or any other AI tool, why do we see it as a person more than a software – thinking it would invade our work and personal life? </ul>

					<ul> > What about AI is so uncanny that people reject, resist, and refrain from using this tool in their daily life? </ul>

					<ul> > The individuality of self we see in AI has changed the story, turning a series of zeros and ones into a threat for many. But is it really?</ul>

				<h3>Artist Statement</h3>

				<p>
				Jessica Lian is an emerging multimedia artist who enjoys exploring the concept of self-identity through various mediums including digital and analog photography, illustrations, and video. She spends her spare time referencing anime characters and doodling in her sketchbook to build on her skills. As technology offered new opportunities in art making, she slowly migrated towards digital mediums. Lian enjoys looking at aesthetic pieces and creating artwork assets such as linearts and pencil sketches which she scans to incorporate into her Unity games and video projects. Her upbringing as a Chinese American also challenges her to use art as a means to discover where she belongs in the mix of two cultures. Her choice of project is a reflection of what she loves such as investigating the rise of AI technologies, critiquing the music industry through her analysis of music video trends of songs she listens to, and experimenting with different art styles to test her theory of losing interest after working on a project for a long period of time.

				<h2>La Leyenda del Chupacabra</h2>
				<p><i>Julio Jesus Ramirez</i></p>
				<h3>Project Statement</h3>

				<p>

				<i>La Leyenda del Chupacabra</i>. An overview of this project is based on a group of journalists who go to Puerto Rico to gather information about the mystery creature” El Chupacabra,” for the purpose of making a Youtube documentary of people’s experiences with the mystery creature. Our project objectives are to provide people with the truth of the existence of el chupacabra and share real experiences of this creature with the Latino-American culture and others. The medium used for this project are real interviews, social media, film festivals, and online marketing. Also, our techniques are based on non-scripted footage and free domain news and clips. The theme and concept of the project is a mockumentary style that is inspired by the mystery of this legend, and its film structure inspired by The Blair Witch Project film. The inspiration of this project came from the lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic. When the government decided to close the Puerto Rican Airport I got stuck on the island with my uncle. We decided to go all over the island renting Airbnb and discovering new things we can only do 6 feet apart from random people. Then we decided to make a movie and started listening to many people sharing their Chupacabra experience, so we decided to move on with this topic for our movie.

				<h3>Artist Statement</h3>

				<p>

				I am Julio Ramirez, a filmmaker and editor hailing from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. My artistic journey commenced as a producer, collaborating closely with my esteemed friend and director, Eddie Liriano. Under his mentorship, I immersed myself in the world of cinema, initially embracing the role of a behind-the-scenes producer, and eventually progressing to the esteemed positions of Assistant Camera and Director of Photography. I enjoy integrating into new cultures and getting involved with their myths and legends. The combination of reality and the uncertainty of mythological existence is one of the key topics in my work.

				<h2>Journey</h2>
				<p><i>Amely Gonell</i></p>
				<h3>Project Statement</h3>

				<p>

				The project, <i>Journey</i>, was created to show the process of being moved by the mind and how it processes concepts through various forms of symbolism and space-time. Everyone, at some point, becomes creatively overwhelmed, feeling depressed and unsure. Everything may seem overwhelming and not worth doing or participating in, so you sleep. However, in the dream state, a lot takes place. For those vivid dreamers, it may even inspire action which is the basis for this entire project. 
				</p>
				This video work combines a digital texture and animation to elicit curiosity about where the story is going. I use bright colors to emphasize the dream-like childish state and shapes to create broken-down versions of the world through the mind's eye. Recreating how the brain breaks down images, experiences, and thoughts through simplified shapes, guiding viewers through a story of our shared experiences. The metaphors utilized are tied together to tell the story of being rushed through life, never having enough time, and being pushed to the brink of transformation to change in waking life. Ending with a jolt of surprise, a rush of energy to bring the idea to life. With this project in particular I have struggled with getting the animation side of things to work with my original idea. Instead, I opted for a scrapbook feel to portray the inner workings of the dream and tried to keep the objects as simple as possible, this made it easier to digest the content I was creating and overcome the same struggles shown in the video. In the end, will you pursue the rush of inspiration or let it be lost to time?

				<h3>Artist Statement</h3>

				<p>

				Amely Gonell (b. 2001) is a painter, illustrator, and mixed media artist who lives and works in New York City. She works in these forms of media because it allows her to reconnect with an inner child that loved art and animals passionately, allowing her to rediscover the fantastical elements lost to adulthood. She is interested in morbid and ancient-esque designs that speak to the darker aspects of the horror she enjoys. She also gains insights from books such as The Lumberjanes and the Goddesses in Everywoman because they highlight women’s empowerment. Following liberal feminist ideology she seeks to understand the intersectionality of all women's struggles and their backgrounds. Attending a diverse all-girls highschool and being friends with primarily women, she strongly values all women's experiences, inclusivity, and empowerment in those bonds built with the people you love most. It touches on the different aspects of women and those who identify as such in personality and goals and how each can seek empowerment and solidarity through their own unique background.  To embody the energy of free women in all aspects and self-mastery is something they value and can be seen interwoven in their mixed media works that explores the inner world of what existing as a woman means to her.

				<h2>Colors</h2>
				<p><i>Julie Li</i></p>
				<h3>Project Statement</h3>

				<p>

				In the contemporary landscape of the information age, an incessant influx of messages inundates our consciousness, perpetuating a ceaseless stream of narratives and headlines. As both artist and protagonist of the tumultuous undulations within social currents, Julie embarks on an exploration into the manifold repercussions of these rapid and capricious trends on our quotidian decision-making processes. 
				</p>
				The opus titled <i>Colors</i> unfolds through the medium of animation, serving as a canvas upon which the artist articulates the intricate interplay between external influences and our internal compass. The central protagonist, an ethereal fluff ball devoid of nomenclature, becomes the vessel through which the narrative manifests. This animated chronicle elucidates the protagonist's odyssey, a journey intricately interwoven with the ebb and flow of societal vogues, encapsulating the ephemeral nature of trends in contemporary media. 
				</p>
				Julie adopts a deliberate minimalistic approach in the execution of this project. The lines and settings maintain a pristine clarity, a deliberate aesthetic choice that harmonizes with the artist's restrained color palette. Colors, or the lack thereof, become a symbolic vehicle, articulating the transient and profound impacts of societal trends on the protagonist's trajectory. The grayscale scenes serve to accentuate these chromatic shifts, creating a visual dichotomy that underscores the dynamism of cultural currents. 
				</p>
				Technological acceleration, a pivotal aspect of this narrative, expedites the genesis and dissemination of new trends and standards. This relentless pace compels individuals to assimilate swiftly, adopting novel beliefs, values, and behaviors to circumvent social exclusion. Julie deftly conveys the mental toll exacted upon the protagonist, whose weariness mirrors the frenetic pace of daily change. 
				</p>
				Through this evocative animation, Julie aspires to forge a connection with her audience, instigating contemplation on the instances when masks are donned. She posits the belief in individual uniqueness and presents a relatively unembellished canvas, inviting viewers to imbue their narratives upon it. In this synthesis of art and introspection, Julie endeavors to cultivate a resonant experience that transcends the temporal and beckons viewers to explore the tapestry of their own narrative.

				<h3>Artist Statement</h3>

				<p>

				Residing within the dynamic cultural landscape of New York, Julie emerges as an artist whose expertise lies in the discipline of drawing, navigating a trajectory that extends from a foundational proficiency in realistic sketches to a recent immersion in the domain of digital art. Drawing inspiration from personal experiences and a diverse array of narratives, her artistic pursuits are centered around a discerning examination of pertinent societal themes, self-identity, and mental health. 

				Coming from an immigrant family, Julie's artistic oeuvre serves as a reflective prism, capturing the echoes of her heritage while traversing the intricate tapestry of contemporary societal complexities. Possessing an effervescent imagination, she strives to encapsulate the nuanced facets of life, employing art as a conduit for self-expression in a world where linguistic articulation may often prove insufficient. 

				As an inherently non-communicative individual, Julie's artistic endeavors assume the form of a visual odyssey, unraveling themes of self-discovery, contemplation, and communication. Through her creations, she articulates the unspoken dialogues that unfold within the recesses of her consciousness. 
				</p>
				In delving into societal concerns, Julie's art transcends personal narratives to scrutinize the profound impacts of these issues on both an individual and collective level. She seeks to provoke contemplation, encouraging viewers to grapple with the intricacies of life while questioning constructs of identity and belonging. 

				Navigating the challenges and uncertainties of college life, her artwork becomes a bridge connecting shared struggles, insecurities, and uncharted territories of the future. Through this visual journey, she extends an invitation to the audience to find solace, connection, and meaning in the shared human experience. 

				In essence, Julie's artistic output is a profound offering—a curated collection of visual narratives that beseech viewers not merely to observe but to actively engage with the profound questions, conflicts, and beauty that underpin the human condition. As she navigates the realms of personal expression, Julie aspires to engender a collective exploration of how individuals make sense of the world and their place within it.
