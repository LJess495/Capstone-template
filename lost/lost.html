				<h2>What I Am Desperately Ashamed Of</h2>
				<p><i>Anika Rios</i></p>
				<h3>Project Statement</h3>

				<p>

				<i>What I Am Desperately Ashamed Of</i> is a video work that discusses the behavioral effects of human isolation and sheds light on the discomfort often associated with it. Viewers are invited into the world through a first-person perspective where they inhabit the body of a habitual skin-picker and people-watcher. The artist, Anika Rios, explores the depth of these concepts through an interplay of color, voiceover, closeups, and editing to reveal an intensely raw aspect of identity and yearning within the human psyche that translates outward. 
				</p>
				Drawing from her personal experiences of self-imposed isolation and anxious habits, Rios weaves a narrative that resonates with the depth of her journey. The video clips capture bits of a 30-minute-long nail-picking episode set against eyes observing the world. The spoken poetry played throughout the piece serves as a glimpse into an internal landscape. The visible manifestations of mental turmoil in the video may be seen as peculiar, but they mirror complex emotions such as fear, worry, anger, and more that often remain concealed behind what society deems as ‘strange’ physical acts. 
				</p>
				The act of shooting was not without its challenges. Rios dealt with intense anxiety as she navigated the cityscape with a large conspicuous briefcase, tripod, and camera. The irony of being both the observer and the observed, coupled with the artist’s reluctance to be seen underscores the dichotomy between watching and longing to remain unwatched.

				<h3>Artist Statement</h3>

				<p>
				Kevin Wang is a multimedia artist based in NYC who loves exploring the balance between the intersection of technology and art to forge innovative expressions around the nuanced themes of multifaceted layers of human identity and the ever-evolving world. Kevin incorporates animation and sound, creating a sensorial experience that adds dimension to his work. Kevin at a young age learned different traditional forms of art such as painting, drawing, and sculpting but the passion for art was momentarily set aside due to parental expectations. After taking classes for his NMA minor at Baruch College, the option to use multimedia elements rekindled his passion for art. Embracing this revived passion, Kevin draws inspiration from the relentless advancement of technology in our ever-changing world. To him, art transcends mere aesthetics; it becomes a profound means of self-expression, a canvas where he translates his observations, emotions, and visions into tangible creations. Through his art, Kevin seeks to capture the essence of the human experience, reflecting the interplay between technology and creativity.

				<h2>Something to Forget</h2>
				<p><i>Eric Ip</i></p>
				<h3>Project Statement</h3>

				<p>

				In <i>Something to Forget</i>, Eric Ip aims to highlight the negativity prevalent in the lives of people within his generation. Life, existence, and the universe are devoid of meaning, purpose, and value often leading to emotional distress, social disconnection, and psychological challenges. Transitioning into our early adulthood, we are often lost, distressed, and helpless against the infinite possibilities forward. Ip's work depicts an introspective dialogue, prompting contemplation on how to transcend perpetual despair, negativity, and ambiguity to forge purpose within a valueless existence. The work reflects Ip's philosophical journey in grappling with nihilism, existentialism, and absurdism. When faced with such hopelessness would it be easier to just give up? Or should we continue anyway despite knowing that it may all be for naught? He hopes to create a conversation that, one day, will be forgotten as viewers embrace the insignificance of everything. To imbue their lives with personal significance despite the inherent meaninglessness of the world.

				<h2>The Absence of Communication</h2>
				<p><i>Matthew Han</i></p>
				<h3>Project Statement</h3>

				<p>

				<p>"Are you truly free?</p>

				We live lives of repetition within a system: eating, sleeping, working. The system is convenient, efficient, and repetitive. Matthew Han's short film <i>The Absence of Communication</i> poses a question: Is a system void of communication and social connection truly humane? It questions the role of societies current social and technological structures not just as a functional entity, but as a space for the life of a being with personality. While the system is efficient, humans are not. In doing so, the film prompts us to reflect upon our own existence within this system. 
				</p>
				The protagonist in the film constantly looks in the mirror but never really sees herself. She eats, but her soul remains unfed. Living in this bland, repetitive system of human society, she experiences anger as a side effect. Her anger is a rebellion and a deviation as a human. Because she is human, she expresses anger. Because she is human, she throws out the message of anger. Anger is not normal. Yet, without it, humans die. It is only when she faces this fierce anger, rather than a cold mirror, that she gets the chance to reflect on herself. However, this introspection is fleeting, and she soon returns to living within the system, passing by this crucial opportunity to confront herself.”

				<h2>TRPPD/BRKNG-FREE</h2>
				<p><i>Jesus Pinto</i></p>
				<h3>Project Statement</h3>

				<p>
					The work titled <i>TRPPD/BRKING-FREE</i> by Jesus Pinto aims to shed light on the materialistic dreams imposed by society, particularly among individuals in our generation who are overly fixated on material possessions. Inspired by the bible verse Mark 8:36, which questions the value of gaining the entire world at the expense of one’s soul, this project seeks to explore the consequences of prioritizing wealth and materialism over the richness of life’s experiences. 
					</p>
					Almost everyone is born with the same amount of wealth, which is time. Time, as a currency, cannot be acquired or increased. It is crucial to consider how we utilize this invaluable resource. Through the conceptual video presented in “TRPPD/BRKING-FREE,” Jesus portrays his imaginative interpretation of the potential consequence of sacrificing time solely for the pursuit of wealth and material possessions.
					
					Jesus employs a combination of film and audio elements, inviting viewers to ponder this message. This work is intended for anyone in life, as it encourages reflection on the true value of time and the potential consequences of fixating on materialistic pursuits.

				<h2>Unveiling Realities: A Cinematic Exploration of Life</h2>
				<p><i>Abiha Amir</i></p>
				<h3>Project Statement</h3>

				<p>
					<i>Unveiling Realities: A Cinematic Exploration of Life</i> Unveiling Realities: Depression and anxiety are something that is part of everyone's lives for free. The cruel reality about stress is that you can play with it and perform it whenever you want. This short story aims to create a compelling and thought-provoking cinematic video that delves deep into the multifaceted aspects of life. This project seeks to challenge common perceptions and portray the raw, unfiltered truths that define the human experience. Through a combination of powerful storytelling, evocative cinematography, and poignant narratives, the project intends to shed light on the realities that often remain hidden beneath the surface. 
					</p>
					This art project delves into the complexities and potential of enduring relationships with one's true reality. It is rooted in emotional connections, revealing the profound facets of life and the challenges inherent in navigating it. My passion for photography ignited around my 12th birthday when I received a Nintendo DS. From capturing spontaneous moments, I derived joy. Over time, my affinity for cinematography blossomed, transforming ordinary videos into dramatic, well-developed shots. 
					</p>
					The project unfolds through cinematic videos that illustrate the dual lives people lead, reflecting their true realities. Throughout the narrative, I explore the boundaries of human consciousness, contemplating what it means to exist beyond the confines of our bodies. 
					</p>
					Crafting this story demanded patience. I employed a mix of my iPhone and camera to capture diverse shots, encountering obstacles in assembling participants and executing the concept effectively. Naturally occurring emotions like anxiety and depression posed challenges in recreating melancholic moods. Additionally, manipulating lighting proved tricky; while desiring dark and gloomy shots, nighttime recording presented quality issues and hindered detail capture. Overcoming these hurdles involved introspection into my own emotions, and imagining the feelings associated with sadness. To address the lighting issue, I incorporated external lights, significantly enhancing the video quality and intensifying the overall impact. 
					</p>
					In conclusion, this art project serves as a poignant exploration into the intricate dynamics of a long-term relationship between an individual and their true reality. Rooted in emotional connections, it unravels the profound essence of life and the inherent challenges that accompany its navigation.
